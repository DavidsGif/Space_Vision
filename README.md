Space Vision is a user interactive Art piece, which main idea is to demonstrate different spectral effects on 3d objects i.e. a cube through shaders. The purpose of Space Vision is to reveal exciting effects that represent different emotions and feelings. The black ground combined with the bright colors represents the idea of ‘Space Vision’
